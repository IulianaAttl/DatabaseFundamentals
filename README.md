# DatabaseProjects

### Assignment.accdb
For this assignment, I have decided to design a database management system for a music instrument manufacturing company. This company has stores in multiple locations selling instruments they manufacture. My application gives a view to the managers about their categories of instruments, the instruments themselves, stores, employees, customers, and sales. 

There are five main categories of instruments. Strings, woodwind, brass, percussion, and keyboards. The user of the application can find out the materials in which each instrument is available by searching for the category.

Each instrument must have a unique number by which it can be identified as well as having one of the five categories and belonging to only one store. This application also stores other information about the instruments such as the instrument name, quantity currently in stock, the origin (where the instrument has been manufactured), and the price of each one.

The stores have a unique id by which they can be identified, the address, phone number, the opening and closing times, the managerâ€™s name, and the email of the store.
All employees must have a unique id. They must all work in only one store. There should not be a store without any employees. This application has records of employees' first name, last name, phone number, address, email, date of birth, salary, and their gender.

The instruments company must also be able to keep track of their customers. Each customer has a unique number by which they can be identified, their first name, last name, address, phone number, date of birth, and gender. 

Finally, and most importantly, this application is designed for the owners of the company to see and keep track of their completed sales. Each sale must have a unique identification number. A sale is complete if it has one or more instruments, if it belongs to one and only one store, if it has been managed by one and only one employee and made by one and only one customer. This entity also stores other information such as the date and time the sale has been made and the method of payment used by the customer.
